We make up for some of the calories we burn during exercise, but not all. Image Credit iStock By  Gretchen Reynolds July 4, 2018 Can working out help us to drop pounds after all? A provocative new study involving overweight men and women suggests that it probably can, undercutting a widespread notion that exercise, by itself, is worthless for weight loss. But the findings also indicate that, to benefit, we may need to exercise quite a bit. In theory, exercise should contribute substantially to weight loss. It burns calories. If we do not replace them, our bodies should achieve negative energy balance, use stored fat for fuel and shed pounds.  But life and our metabolisms are not predictable or fair, as multiple exercise studies involving people and animals show. In these experiments, participants lose less weight than would be expected, given the energy they expend during exercise. The studies generally have concluded that the exercisers had compensated for the energy they had expended during exercise, either by eating more or moving less throughout the day. These compensations were often unwitting but effective. Some researchers had begun to wonder, though, if the amount of exercise might matter. Many of the past human experiments had involved about 30 minutes a day or so of moderate exercise, which is the amount generally recommended by current guidelines to improve health. But what if people exercised more, some researchers asked. Would they still compensate for all the calories that they burned? To find out, scientists from the University of North Dakota and other institutions decided to invite 31 overweight, sedentary men and women to a lab for measurements of their resting metabolic rate and body composition. The volunteers also recounted in detail what they had eaten the previous day and agreed to wear a sophisticated activity tracker for a week. The scientists then randomly divided them into groups. One group began a program of walking briskly or otherwise exercising five times a week until they had burned 300 calories, which took most of them about 30 minutes. (The sessions were individualized.) Over the course of the week, these volunteers burned 1,500 extra calories with their exercise program. The other group began working out for twice as long, burning 600 calories per session, or about 3,000 calories per week. The exercise program lasted for 12 weeks. The researchers asked their volunteers not to change their diets or lifestyles during this time and to wear the activity monitors for a few days. After four months, everyone returned to the lab and repeated the original tests. The results must have been disconcerting for some of them. Those men and women who had burned about 1,500 calories a week with exercise turned out to have lost little if any body fat, the tests showed. Some were heavier. But most of those who had walked twice as much were thinner now. Twelve of them had shed at least 5 percent of their body fat during the study. The researchers then used mathematical calculations, based on each person\\u2019s fat loss (if any), to determine whether and by how much they had compensated for their exercise. The men and women in the group that had burned 1,500 calories a week with exercise proved to have compensated for nearly 950 of those calories, the numbers indicated. Interestingly, those in the other group had also compensated for some of the calories they had burned, and to almost the exact same extent as those who had exercised less, adding back about 1,000 calories a week, the calculations showed.  But since they had expended 3,000 calories a week, they had wound up with a weekly deficit of about 2,000 calories from exercise and lost fat, the researchers concluded. The findings were published in the American Journal of Physiology-Regulatory, Integrative and Comparative Physiology. How the volunteers had compensated was not absolutely clear, says Kyle Flack, an assistant professor at the University of Kentucky, who conducted the experiment as part of his graduate research. People\\u2019s resting metabolic rates had not changed during the study, he says, whichever group they had been in. Their activity monitors also showed few differences in how much or little they moved during the day. So the caloric compensation must have involved overeating, he says. But the volunteers did not think so. \\u201cTheir food recall did not show differences\\u201d in how much they reported eating at the start and end of the study, Dr. Flack says. \\u201cI think they just did not realize that they were eating more,\\u201d he says. There probably also are complicated interconnections between exercise, appetite and people\\u2019s relationships to food that were not picked up during this study and can affect eating and weight, he says. He hopes to study those issues in future studies. But already, the results from this experiment are encouraging, if cautionary. \\u201cIt looks like you can lose weight with exercise,\\u201d Dr. Flack says. But success may require more exertion of our bodies and will than we might hope, he adds. \\u201cThirty minutes of exercise was not enough\\u201d in this study to overcome the natural drive to replace the calories we burn during a workout. \\u201cSixty minutes of exercise was better,\\u201d he says. But even then, people replaced about a third of the calories they expended during exercise. \\u201cYou still have to count calories and weigh portions\\u201d if you hope to use exercise to control your weight, he says.

You Probably Need to Do Both Moderate exercise does different things to the body than incidental activities like standing up. Image Eric L. Adams, the Brooklyn borough president, uses a standing desk as part of his fitness routine. Credit Katherine Taylor for The New York Times By  Gretchen Reynolds June 13, 2018 Exercise alone is probably not enough for us to achieve and maintain good health. We must also try to sit less, according to a fascinating new study of the separate physiological effects that exercise and light, almost-incidental activities, such as standing up, can have on our bodies. By now, we all know that regular exercise is good for us. The United States  national exercise guidelines, which are based on a wealth of scientific evidence, recommend at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise each week in order to lengthen our life spans and reduce our risks of a variety of diseases. In practice, this recommendation translates into 30 minutes almost daily of exercise that should be brisk enough to raise our heart rates and make us gasp a bit for breath. But exercising 30 minutes a day leaves us plenty of time for other activities, the primary one of which (apart from sleeping) tends to be sitting. A typical office worker can easily log more than 10 or 11 hours a day in a chair, according to studies of how we spend our time. These long stretches of sitting have been associated with a variety of health concerns, including increased risks for diabetes, obesity and poor cholesterol profiles. But whether a single session of exercise most days can reduce or cancel out those risks or whether we also need to find ways to sit less has remained scientifically uncertain. So for the new study, which was published this month in Scientific Reports , researchers at Maastricht University in the Netherlands decided to ask several groups of men and women to upend their lives temporarily for science. Some of the 61 adults whom the scientists recruited were normal weight and generally healthy; others were overweight; and still others both overweight and diabetic. None exercised regularly. The scientists invited these men and women to the university performance lab and tested them for various markers of cardiac and metabolic health, including insulin resistance and cholesterol levels. Then the researchers had each volunteer complete three distinct, four-day sessions of living calculatedly exaggerated lifestyles. During one, the men and women sat for 14 hours a day, their chair time interrupted only by bathroom breaks.  During another of the four-day sessions, they substituted one hour of their sitting time with exercise, pedaling a stationary bicycle at a moderate pace for an hour. The other 13 hours, they were back in a chair. Finally, for the third of the sessions, they sat for about eight hours a day but spent the other five or six hours of their waking time standing or strolling about at a casual, meandering pace. The calories that they burned during these activities, whether cycling or standing and light walking, were about the same. After each four-day block, the scientists repeated the health tests from the start and then compared them. The results diverged in illuminating ways after each session. After four days of sitting nonstop, the men and women showed greater insulin resistance and undesirable changes in their cholesterol levels. They also had blood markers showing detrimental changes to their endothelial cells, which line our blood vessels, including our arteries; when those cells are unhealthy, the risk of cardiac disease rises. In effect, four days of uninterrupted sitting seemed to be undermining the volunteers\\u2019 metabolic and heart health, including among those who had no symptoms of metabolic problems at the start. But after four days that included moderate bicycling, the volunteers displayed enhanced endothelial cell health, compared to when they had sat nonstop. Their insulin sensitivity and cholesterol profiles were unchanged, though. On the other hand, insulin and cholesterol levels both were better after four days of standing or strolling for at least five hours a day, the scientists found. But the volunteers\\u2019 endothelial-cell health had not budged. The light activity seemed not to have affected that marker of heart health. Over all, the results suggest that exercise and standing up have distinct effects on the body, says Bernard Duvivier, a postdoctoral researcher at Maastricht University, who led the new study. Moderate exercise seems to hone endothelial and cardiac health, he says, probably in large part by increasing the flow of blood through blood vessels. Standing up, on the other hand, may have a more pronounced and positive impact on metabolism, he says, perhaps by increasing the number of muscular contractions that occur throughout the day. Busy muscles burn blood sugar for fuel, which helps to keep insulin levels steady, and release chemicals that can reduce bad cholesterol.  Of course, this study was small and quite short-term, with each session lasting only four days. Over a longer period of time, the biological impacts of both moderate exercise and less sitting would likely become broader and more encompassing. But even so, the findings are compelling, Dr. Duvivier says, especially for those of us who often are deskbound. \\u201cPeople should understand,\\u201d he says, \\u201cthat only moderate exercise is not enough and it\\u2019s also necessary to reduce prolonged sitting.\\u201d A version of this article appears in print on , on Page D 6 of the New York edition with the headline: Exercise vs. Standing?

       " u'   Sections SEARCH Skip to content Skip to site index Health Subscribe Log In Subscribe Log In Advertisement Supported by Survey: Exercise and Obesity Are Both Rising in US By  The Associated Press June 28, 2018 NEW YORK \\u2014 It may seem like a contradiction, but more adults in the U.S. say they are exercising at the same time more of them are becoming obese. About 24 percent of adults last year said they exercise enough each week to meet government recommendations for both muscle strengthening and aerobic exercise, according to a large annual health survey. That was up from 21 percent in 2015. The same survey says 31 percent of adults indicated they were obese last year, up slightly. Another, more rigorous government study has also found adult obesity is inching up. So if more Americans are exercising, how can more also be getting fatter? Some experts think the findings may reflect two sets of people \\u2014 the haves and have-nots of physical fitness, so to speak. \"It\\'s possible the people becoming more active are already normal weight,\" said John Jakicic, director of the University of Pittsburgh\\'s Physical Activity and Weight Management Research Center. The numbers come from an in-person annual national survey that for more than 60 years has been an important gauge of U.S. health trends. Roughly 35,000 adults answer the survey every year, including questions about how often, how long and how vigorously they exercise in their leisure time. The survey gives a good sense of trends, but it\\'s not perfect. People generally overstate how much they exercise, just as they overstate their height and lowball their weight, Jakicic said. Ten-year-old federal recommendations say adults should do weightlifting or other muscle-strengthening exercise at least twice a week. They also advise adults to do at least 75 minutes a week of high-intensity aerobic activity, such as running, or 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise, such as brisk walking, or a combination of the two. In a report being released Thursday, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention looked at survey responses from 2010 through 2015 and found that level of leisure-time exercise was more common in some states than others. Nearly a third of non-elderly adults in Colorado, Idaho, and New Hampshire met exercise guidelines. Only about one-seventh in Mississippi, Kentucky and South Carolina did. Higher levels of exercise were more common in people who were working than those who weren\\'t, the study also found. Nationally, exercise levels were flat during the years covered by the CDC report. But more recent data show more adults said they were exercising at recommended levels in 2016 and 2017. It\\'s not clear why, said Jena Shaw Tronieri, a University of Pennsylvania weight-loss expert. One possibility: Many adults exercise to manage stress, and the last two years have seen increasing political and social turmoil. \"I don\\'t know if that will explain the increase recently, but we know those situational factors are part of the context,\" she said. Of course, unhealthy eating has a lot to do with obesity. Research indicates that \"a change in diet is needed to see any dent or reduction in obesity,\" said the CDC\\'s Tainya Clarke, one of the authors of the report. ___ The Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\\'s Department of Science Education.

According to a new review of research about good moods and physical activity, people who work out even once a week or for as little as 10 minutes a day tend to be more cheerful than those who never exercise. And any type of exercise may be helpful. The idea that moving can affect our moods is not new. Many of us would probably say that we feel less cranky or more relaxed after a jog or visit to the gym. Science would generally agree with us. A number of past studies have noted that physically active people have much lower risks of developing depression and anxiety than people who rarely move. But that research centered on the relationships between exercise and psychological problems like depression and anxiety. Fewer past studies explored links between physical activity and upbeat emotions, especially in people who already were psychologically healthy, and those studies often looked at a single age group or type of exercise. On their own, they do not tell us much about the amounts or types of exercise that might best lift our moods, or whether most of us might expect to find greater happiness with regular exercise or only certain groups of people. So for the new review, in The Journal of Happiness Studies , researchers at the University of Michigan decided to aggregate and analyze multiple past studies of working out and happiness. They began by combing research databases for relevant studies and wound up with 23 published since 1980. Most of those were observational, meaning that the scientists simply looked at a group of people, asking them how much they worked out and how happy they were. A few of the studies were experiments in which people started exercising and researchers measured their happiness before and after. The number of participants in any one study was often small, but together, they represented more than 500,000 people ranging in age from adolescents to the very old and covering a broad range of ethnic and socioeconomic groups. And for most of them, the Michigan researchers found, exercise was strongly linked to happiness. \\u201cEvery one of the observational studies showed a beneficial relationship between being physically active and being happy,\\u201d says Weiyun Chen, an associate professor of kinesiology at the University of Michigan, who, with her graduate student Zhanjia Zhang, wrote the review. The type of exercise did not seem to matter. Some happy people walked or jogged. Others practiced yoga-style posing and stretching. And the amount of exercise needed to influence happiness was slight, Dr. Chen says. In several studies, people who worked out only once or twice a week said they felt much happier than those who never exercised. In other studies, 10 minutes a day of physical activity was linked with buoyant moods. But more movement generally contributed to greater happiness. If people exercised for at least 30 minutes on most days, which is the standard American and European recommendation for good health, Dr. Chen says, they were about 30 percent more likely to consider themselves happy than people who did not meet the guidelines. \\u201cI think the indications are strong that exercise can contribute to happiness and, while anything helps, a bit more is probably better,\\u201d she says. But because most of the studies in this review were observational, she says, it is not possible yet to establish whether exercise directly causes changes in happiness or if the two just happen to occur together often. It could be that happy people are more likely to take up exercise and continue with it than people who feel sad. In that case, exercise would not have helped to make people happy; rather, their happiness would have helped to make them exercisers. Happiness also is an inherently subjective, squishy concept. The studies analyzed in the review asked people how happy they felt. But one person\\u2019s happiness could be another\\u2019s relative gloom, making it difficult to generalize about how any of us might react, emotionally, to starting an exercise routine. And, of course, the review did not delve into how exercise could be influencing happiness. \\u201cThere are indications that social factors could mediate the effects of exercise on happiness for some people,\\u201d Dr. Chen says. In other words, the social interactions that occur during an exercise class or trip to the gym might help to elevate people\\u2019s moods. Or exercise could more directly change the body, including the brain. \\u201cWe know that exercise improves health,\\u201d Dr. Chen says, \\u201cand feeling healthier might make people feel happier.\\u201d Exercise might also remodel the brain, for example, by prompting the creation of new brain cells or inducing changes in brain chemicals, in ways that contribute to positive emotions. Dr. Chen hopes that future experiments will explore these issues. But for now, she says, \\u201cI think that we can safely say that people who exercise are probably going to be happier than people who don\\u2019t.\\u201d Correction :  An earlier version of this article misstated when the new review of research was published.

       " u\"   Sections SEARCH Skip to content Skip to site index Move Subscribe Log In Subscribe Log In Advertisement Supported by Phys Ed Hate High-Intensity Exercise? Try It. You Might Like It. Just trying a H.I.I.T. workout for the first time may be a critical step in including high-intensity training as part of your everyday routine. Image Credit Kirsten Luce for The New York Times By  Gretchen Reynolds May 30, 2018 Few people interested in fitness are unfamiliar with the concept of high-intensity interval training, or H.I.I.T., which involves very short, very strenuous bursts of exercise interspersed with periods of rest. But many people are intimidated to try such workouts. As my colleague Tara Parker-Pope reported recently , using a heart-rate monitor helped her overcome her fear of H.I.I.T. But a new study shows that for many, just trying an H.I.I.T. workout for the first time may be a critical step in including high-intensity training as part of your everyday routine. The study undercuts some widespread assumptions about the psychological effects of intense exercise and also indicates that short, hard workouts could be a practical alternative to other forms of exercise in part because we do not hate them. H.I.I.T. has gained considerable attention in recent years, thanks to experiments showing that even a few minutes a week of strenuous intervals improve aerobic fitness and other aspects of health as much as hours of jogging or moderate bicycle riding. But some scientists have argued that the potential physical benefits from intense training will be illusory if people do not complete the workouts. Their concerns are based on past research showing that if exercise is intense, most people report not liking it. But those studies primarily examined nonstop intense exercise, such as continuous, hard bicycling or running, and not interval training, which interrupts the strenuous exertion with rest periods. So for the new study, which was published in May in Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise , researchers from the University of British Columbia in Kelowna and McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, decided to ask a group of ordinary people to try a variety of workouts and see if they liked them. The researchers began by gathering 30 men and women who were inactive in general and had not tried interval training before. They brought them into the lab, tested their fitness and familiarized them with different measures of how they felt during exercise. One of these asked them to estimate the relative intensity of a workout on a scale of 1 to 10, while another required rating the pleasantness (if any) of a workout on a similar numeric scale. They then had each volunteer complete three workouts on separate days. During one, the participants rode a stationary bicycle for 45 minutes at a steady, moderate pace. During another, they tried standard high-intensity interval training, riding hard for one minute, resting for a minute, and repeating the sequence 10 times. For the last workout, they were introduced to super-high-intensity training, consisting of pedaling as hard as they possibly could for 30 seconds three times, with two minutes of rest between each grunting bout of all-out pedaling. Capitalizing on the rest periods between intervals, the researchers repeatedly asked the men and women to assess how they felt during their exertions and also, afterward, to rank each workout according to which had been most and least enjoyable. Then, in perhaps the most important element of the study, the scientists waved farewell to their volunteers, but asked them to keep logs of their physical activities for a month, to see if people would choose to continue any of the workouts on their own. To no one\\u2019s surprise, when the scientists tallied results, the cyclists proved to have unanimously reported less fatigue and more happiness during the moderate pedaling, especially if the researchers checked in near the end of either of the sessions of tiring intervals. But afterward, with the exercise behind them, people\\u2019s opinions shifted and almost all of the volunteers decided that, in retrospect, they had found the workouts almost equally enjoyable and would in fact rank the standard, high-intensity interval training as the most pleasant. About 80 percent of them also tried at least one session of interval training in the month after the experiment, although they completed more moderate workouts in that time. These findings indicate that intervals could be less onerous than many of us probably expect, says Matthew Stork, a doctoral student at the University of British Columbia who led the study. While perhaps not a ringing endorsement of the joys of strenuous exercise, the results also suggest that how you feel during a draining interval workout may not reflect how you will feel afterward, Mr. Stork says, and you might even find that you wish to repeat the hard workout again. But this study was small, of course, and involved only one supervised session of each workout. It cannot tell us whether everyone will develop similar emotional responses to intense training or whether our feelings about the exercise might change with experience or greater fitness. The study also reinforces the fundamental message about intervals, which is that they are hard and physically difficult, which some people will never enjoy. Still, Mr. Stork says, if you are pressed for time, brief interval sessions might offer a viable way to fit exercise into your life. \\u201cAnd you can\\u2019t know whether you will enjoy them or not,\\u201d he says, \\u201cuntil you try them.\\u201d A version of this article appears in print on , on Page D 4 of the New York edition with the headline: Turn Up the Intensity, if You Dare .
